      {
        question: "How do I connect my wallet to Predictify?",
        answer: "To connect your wallet: 1) Click the 'Connect Wallet' button in the top navigation, 2) Select your preferred wallet from the list (Freighter, Albedo, etc.), 3) Follow the prompts to authorize the connection. Make sure you have a Stellar-compatible wallet installed."
      },
      {
        question: "What wallets are supported?",
        answer: "Predictify supports all major Stellar wallets including Freighter, Albedo, WalletConnect, and xBull. We recommend Freighter for the best experience as it's the most widely used Stellar wallet."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need XLM to use Predictify?",
        answer: "Yes, you need a small amount of XLM for transaction fees on the Stellar network. Each prediction requires a minimal fee (usually less than 0.01 XLM). You'll also need XLM or USDC to place bets."
      }

    icon: <TrendingUp className="w-5 h-5" />,
    questions: [
      {
        question: "How do I place a prediction bet?",
        answer: "To place a bet: 1) Browse available markets on the dashboard, 2) Click on a market you're interested in, 3) Choose your prediction outcome, 4) Enter your bet amount, 5) Review the odds and potential payout, 6) Click 'Place Bet' and confirm the transaction in your wallet."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the minimum bet amount?",
        answer: "The minimum bet amount is 1 USDC or equivalent in XLM. This helps ensure meaningful participation while keeping the platform accessible to all users."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I cancel a bet after placing it?",
        answer: "Once a bet is confirmed on the blockchain, it cannot be cancelled. Make sure to review your prediction carefully before confirming the transaction. However, you may be able to hedge your position by betting on other outcomes in the same market."
      },
      {
        question: "How are odds calculated?",
        answer: "Odds are determined by the collective betting activity of all users in a market. When more people bet on an outcome, its odds decrease (lower payout), and when fewer people bet on it, the odds increase (higher payout). This creates a dynamic, market-driven pricing system."
      }
    ]

    category: "Payouts & Rewards",
    icon: <CreditCard className="w-5 h-5" />,
    questions: [
      {
        question: "When do I receive my winnings?",
        answer: "Winnings are automatically distributed to your wallet once the market is resolved. This typically happens within 24-48 hours after the event concludes and the outcome is verified by our oracle system."
      },
      {
        question: "How are payouts calculated?",
        answer: "Your payout = (Your bet amount) Ã— (Odds at time of bet). For example, if you bet 10 USDC at 2.5x odds, you'll receive 25 USDC total (15 USDC profit + 10 USDC original bet) if you win."
      },
      {
        question: "Are there any fees on winnings?",
        answer: "Predictify charges a 2% platform fee on winnings only. You never pay fees on losing bets. This fee helps maintain the platform and fund development of new features."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if a market is cancelled?",
        answer: "If a market is cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances, all bets are refunded to participants' wallets minus network transaction fees. We strive to avoid cancellations by carefully vetting all markets before listing."

    questions: [
      {
        question: "My wallet isn't connecting. What should I do?",
        answer: "Try these steps: 1) Refresh the page and try again, 2) Make sure your wallet extension is unlocked, 3) Clear your browser cache and cookies, 4) Disable other wallet extensions temporarily, 5) Try using an incognito/private browser window."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use multiple wallets?",
        answer: "Yes, you can connect different wallets, but each session only supports one active wallet at a time. To switch wallets, disconnect the current one and connect your preferred wallet."
      },
      {
        question: "Is my wallet secure on Predictify?",
        answer: "Yes, Predictify never stores your private keys or has access to your funds beyond what you explicitly authorize for each transaction. We use industry-standard security practices and only interact with your wallet through secure, audited protocols."

    questions: [
      {
        question: "Transactions are failing. What's wrong?",
        answer: "Common causes: 1) Insufficient XLM for fees, 2) Network congestion, 3) Wallet authorization timeout. Try ensuring you have enough XLM, wait a few minutes, and retry the transaction."
      },
      {
        question: "The page is loading slowly or not at all.",
        answer: "This may be due to network issues or high traffic. Try refreshing the page, checking your internet connection, or clearing your browser cache. If problems persist, try accessing the site from a different device or network."
      },
      {
        question: "I don't see my recent transaction.",
        answer: "Stellar transactions typically confirm within 3-5 seconds, but may take longer during high network activity. Check the transaction status in your wallet or on StellarExpert.io using your transaction hash."
